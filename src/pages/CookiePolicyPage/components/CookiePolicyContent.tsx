          The most important issue first: data privacy is a matter of trust, and
          your trust is important to us. We respect your privacy and your
          personal sphere. Protection and legal processing of your personal data
          are therefore important issues to us. To ensure that you feel secure
          when visiting our web pages, whenever we process your personal data,
          we strictly comply with the legal provisions, and want to let you know
          how we process your personal data.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          In this document you will find out more on how we use and process your
          personal data. We are certain that the information is easy to read and
          transparent, so that you will understand what we want to say, without
          having a hard time. Furthermore, you will learn how you can contact us
          in case you have any questions regarding your personal data, which we
          will be more than happy to answer. Therefore, please read our rules
          regarding cookies, where we inform you how HRS uses cookies and
          similar technologies. You will find our cookie policy in the footer
          navigation at the bottom of our website.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          In case you have already used our service, you already know that HRS
          offers travel-related online services on its own web page and via
          mobile apps as well as other online platforms, such as partner
          websites. The data privacy notice below explains which data are
          collected on our platforms, which data are processed and used, and
          how.

          You can print or store this document by using the usual functionality
          of your Internet service program (= browser: in most cases, "File" →
          "Save as"). Our data privacy rules may change from time to time. As
          long as you care about your privacy, we recommend that you visit this
          page on a regular basis to ensure that you are always aware of the
          latest developments. We wish you a relaxing and nice trip!

          Which types of personal data are collected by HRS, and on what kind of
          legal basis?
        </Title>
        <Paragraph>
          Without any information, we are unable to find the perfect
          accommodation and venue (hereinafter together "Premises") for you.
          When you use our service, we ask you for specific information. This is
          basic information such as your name, your contact data, the name of
          guests accompanying you, and your payment information. This
          information is required to carry out the respective agency orders as
          defined by Article 6, Paragraph 1, letter b Alt. 1 of the General Data
          Protection Regulation. However, we herewith expressly inform you that
          you are not legally required to provide any personal data to us – if
          you refrain from doing so, however, this may impact the services we
          are able to offer to you. For example, you will certainly understand
          that, in case you do not specify any destination, we will be unable to
          make any bookings of Premises.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          In addition, we collect information regarding your computer. This may
          be your IP address, the browser you use, and your language settings.
          It is also possible that we receive information about you from third
          parties or automatically collect other kinds of information. As long
          as we have received your consent in this respect, data processing is
          based on Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter a of the General Data
          Protection Regulation; as long as these measures are necessary for
          technical reasons to ensure the functionality of our web pages and
          services, this is covered by Article 6, Paragraph 1, letter f of the
          General Data Protection Regulation. Our interest in the security of
          our offers is essential considering that, in the case of insufficient
          IT security, its operation as such – just like your personal data –
          would be greatly jeopardized. We additionally ensure that your
          interests in this regard are protected through reasonable measures,
          e.g. data anonymization or pseudonymization. Finally, please note that
          there is no automatic decision-making process, e.g. within the scope
          of automatic profiling.

        <Container>
          <Paragraph>
            HRS.de collects and processes information you provide to us. When
            you make a booking, you are asked to provide (at least) your name
            and your e-mail address. We may possibly ask you to indicate your
            residence, your phone number, payment information, the name of any
            guests traveling and staying with you, and possible preferences you
            may have regarding your stay.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            When you contact our Customer Service team or contact us in another
            manner (for example via social media or through communication with
            the Premises booked by you via our website), we also collect
            information regarding these events about you. After a stay, you may
            receive a request to provide a guest rating to assist future guests
            to find the Premises they are specifically looking for.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            You also provide us with information in other ways. For example,
            when surfing with your mobile device, you may allow HRS to access
            your current location or your contact details - this helps us offer
            you the best possible service. You may also create a user account to
            store your personal settings, view prior bookings, or plan and
            manage future bookings. You may possibly participate in referral
            programs or sweepstakes, which once again means that you provide us
            with personal information. In addition, you may send us feedback or
            ask us to assist you to use the HRS service.

            Personal information we receive from you about others
          </SubTitle>
          <Paragraph>
            Of course, you may possibly not just book for yourself, but are
            rather joined by other guests about whom you provide information
            when making a booking, or you may possibly make a booking for
            someone else. In some cases, you can use HRS to share information
            with others, for example, when sharing the desired Premises or
            participating in a referral program. All of these data, however, are
            only processed in the same manner as indicated there. In this
            respect, you can find additional information on the respective
            pages.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            However, we must inform you that it is your responsibility to ensure
            that the persons about whom you provide personal information are
            aware of such action, and that they have accepted the manner in
            which HRS will use such information.

            Personal information automatically collected by us
          </SubTitle>
          <Paragraph>
            When you visit our websites or use our apps, and even if you do not
            make any booking, we automatically process the following data: IP
            address, date and time of your access to our services, hardware,
            software or browser type, operating system of your computer,
            application version, and language settings, as well as information
            regarding clicks and the pages accessed by you.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            When using a mobile device, the following data may be collected:
            type of mobile device and its device-specific settings and
            properties as well as your geographical location, information
            regarding app crashes, as well as other system activities. Whenever
            you complete a booking, our system records which website and/or apps
            carried out this booking or via which other web pages you made your
            booking on HRS.

            Personal information we receive from other sources
          </SubTitle>
          <Paragraph>
            However, we not only receive the data you provide to us – we may
            possibly also receive information about you from other sources. This
            includes business partners such as our affiliate partners and other
            independent third parties, and all information we receive from them
            may be compiled with the information you provide to us. Perhaps you
            do think that it is strange that we receive information about you
            from our business partners. No worries, everything is OK, and this
            is easy to explain.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            The Premises booking service of HRS is not only available to you on
            HRS and via the HRS apps, but it is actually also offered on partner
            sites as an integrated part of their online service. Whenever you
            use them, you provide your booking details to our business partners
            who, in turn, provide this information to us. We also integrate the
            services of other providers to process payment between the booking
            party and the accommodation. Providers share payment information to
            allow us to process your booking and ensure that the payment process
            is as smooth as possible for you.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Another example would be that we possibly integrate calling services
            on our platforms, which allow you to contact the Premises booked by
            you about your booking. In this case, we receive metadata regarding
            the call (for example place of the call, your identity, and the date
            as well as length of the call).
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Premises partners may also share information about you with HRS. For
            example, this may be the case if you have any questions about your
            pending booking, whenever there are disputes regarding a booking, or
            in the case of other communications about your booking via HRS.
