    title: 'Candor',
    content: `We believe in being forthright, even when that's difficult. We avoid
euphemism or otherwise cloaking our opinions or experience. We respect
those who speak candidly, even if we disagree with what they are
saying`,

    title: 'Resilience',
    content: `We believe in the words of the late mathematician Piet Hein: "problems worthy of attack prove their worth by fighting back."
    We persist even when problems are fighting back, pushing through the disappointment and setbacks endemic to our chosen domain.`,

    title: 'Responsibility',
    content: `We feel a duty to things larger than ourselves. We don't merely fulfill our obligations, 
    but actively seek ways we can help. We balance our professional responsibilities with our personal and familial ones, and we honor those who do the same.`,

    title: 'Teamwork',
    content: `We are intensely team-oriented people: we draw strength and inspiration from the terrific people we are lucky to work with. 
    We like to collaborate, and believe that our best work comes when we work not merely together but for one another.`,

  {
    title: 'Transparency',
    content: `We believe that secrets are often corrosive â€“ and that we work most effectively when we are aware of broader context. 
    We err on the side of transparency and communication: every Oxide employee should feel that there is a standing invitation to any meeting. 
    At the same time, we are respectful of privacy: personnel issues should remain private.`,
  },
  {
    title: 'Courage',
    content: `We are bold, willing to do things even if they are unconventional, difficult, scary or otherwise unproven.
     We are not, however, foolhardy: where we are contrarian, it comes not from mere desire to take a less traveled path, but from a deep and well-informed conviction.`,
